# LikeBot
A discord bot that messages you when you have received a reaction on a message. 
Can be customized to only do so for whitelisted/blacklisted reactions, and is by default off in all channels when invited to a server. 
Must be enabled manually in each channel. By default in whitelist mode with empty whitelist.
